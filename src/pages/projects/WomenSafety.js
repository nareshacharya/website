        <h1>Women Safety Mobile App</h1>
        <p>
          A mobile-first safety app offering real-time SOS alerts, trip tracking, and access to police support ‚Äî built to protect women in everyday situations.

        <h2><FaShieldAlt className="section-icon" /> The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Women commuters felt unsafe during late-night travel and emergencies. Accessing help was slow, and most tools didn‚Äôt connect users directly to patrol or police in real time.
          We set out to build a digital safety net ‚Äî simple, fast, and always connected.
        </p>

        <h2><FaUserTie className="section-icon" /> My Role as Head of Product & Design</h2>
        <p>
          I owned the entire design and product leadership cycle ‚Äî from defining the feature set with law enforcement to testing the app with working women and students.
          I orchestrated UX workshops, aligned with backend developers, and ensured strict performance and privacy standards were met.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also drove integration with patrol vehicles, real-time CCTV access, and created public comms guidelines for city launch.

        <h2><FaCogs className="section-icon" /> Implementation Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          We worked closely with police control room integration teams and mobile backend engineers.  
          I handled live testing with officers and citizen focus groups and prioritized frictionless onboarding to build trust and encourage downloads.

        <h2><FaHeart className="section-icon" /> What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
          Designing for safety means designing with empathy.  
          In moments of panic, speed, simplicity, and trust matter more than features. That shaped every screen and decision we made.

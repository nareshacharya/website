        <h1>TAL Insurance ‚Äì UX Assessment for Service & Underwriting Portals</h1>
        <p>
          A 3-week UX deep-dive into TAL‚Äôs Pega applications ‚Äî the Customer Service Portal (CSP) and Akuna Underwriting Workbench ‚Äî to improve usability, consistency, and Constellation readiness.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="case-section">
        <h2><FaLayerGroup className="section-icon" /> The Context</h2>
        <p>
          TAL‚Äôs Pega application served multiple user groups via two portals built on the same codebase ‚Äî CSP for Customer Service and Akuna for Underwriting.
          Over time, inconsistencies in UI patterns, nested flows, and ad-hoc case handling led to increasing complexity and lowered user confidence.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="case-section">
        <h2><FaUserTie className="section-icon" /> My Role as Head of UX Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          I led this engagement end-to-end: from stakeholder workshops and UX maturity analysis to redesign proposals and executive playback.
          I defined a week-by-week strategy, facilitated hands-on reviews, and created migration paths that aligned with TAL‚Äôs long-term Constellation goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also aligned the dev team on effort vs. value tradeoffs and guided my design team through a feasibility-informed redesign of both portals.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="case-section">
        <h2><FaSearch className="section-icon" /> UX Assessment Plan</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Stakeholder workshops, process walkthroughs, heuristic review</li>
          <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Persona definition, user journey mapping, usability documentation</li>
          <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Design proposals, Constellation readiness matrix, dev alignment</li>
          <li>Reviewed 12+ case types, 3 personas, and UI friction in over 25 screens</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className="case-section">
        <h2><FaDraftingCompass className="section-icon" /> Key Design Insights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSP was eligible for direct Constellation uplift ‚Üí proposed modular case types with clean layouts</li>
          <li>Akuna lacked a Constellation version ‚Üí proposed a UI Kit uplift that visually mimicked Constellation</li>
          <li>Split interaction modes (CSR vs. Underwriter) led to UI control confusion</li>
          <li>Action buttons, screen titles, and case journey indicators were inconsistently placed</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className="case-section">
        <h2><FaCogs className="section-icon" /> Solution Architecture & Rollout Plan</h2>
        <p>
          I proposed a two-track solution:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Track 1 (CSP):</strong> Use Pega‚Äôs native Constellation version and build new case types from scratch in a phased approach</li>
          <li><strong>Track 2 (Akuna):</strong> Apply visual uplift using UI Kit, with reusable component system mimicking Constellation styling</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I also introduced a reusable UI template system to maintain visual parity across portals and future-proof the design system.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="case-section">
        <h2><FaTrophy className="section-icon" /> Outcomes & Impact</h2>
        <p>
          TAL‚Äôs leadership team appreciated the clear path to modernization without replatforming risk.  
          Developers validated that ~70% of the proposed Akuna design uplift could be implemented with moderate effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          My team‚Äôs Figma designs are now being used as the base for the phased rollout of new CSP case types using Constellation.

      <div className="case-section">
        <h2><FaLightbulb className="section-icon" /> Key Takeaway</h2>
        <p>
          Modernization doesn‚Äôt always mean a full rebuild.  
          By aligning design direction with technical feasibility and Pega‚Äôs product roadmap, we unlocked transformation ‚Äî without disruption.
